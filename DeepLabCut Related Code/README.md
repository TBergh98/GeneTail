This folder contains the templates for pre-processing and post-processing related to DeepLabCut projects.

Each notebook contains the operations to be done before/after the phases that require the use of a GPU (for which we move to a cloud service like Google Colab).

The order of the notebooks is as follows:
1. `preprocessing_template.ipynb`
2. `gpu_part_template.ipynb`
3. `post_processing_template.ipynb`
